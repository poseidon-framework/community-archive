  abstract = "There are many unanswered questions about the population history
              of the Central and South Central Andes, particularly regarding
              the impact of large-scale societies, such as the Moche, Wari,
              Tiwanaku, and Inca. We assembled genome-wide data on 89
              individuals dating from ∼9,000-500 years ago (BP), with a
              particular focus on the period of the rise and fall of state
              societies. Today's genetic structure began to develop by 5,800
              BP, followed by bi-directional gene flow between the North and
              South Highlands, and between the Highlands and Coast. We detect
              minimal admixture among neighboring groups between ∼2,000-500 BP,
              although we do detect cosmopolitanism (people of diverse
              ancestries living side-by-side) in the heartlands of the Tiwanaku
              and Inca polities. We also highlight cases of long-range mobility
              connecting the Andes to Argentina and the Northwest Andes to the
              Amazon Basin. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",
