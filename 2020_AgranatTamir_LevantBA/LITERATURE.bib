  abstract = "We report genome-wide DNA data for 73 individuals from five
              archaeological sites across the Bronze and Iron Ages Southern
              Levant. These individuals, who share the ``Canaanite'' material
              culture, can be modeled as descending from two sources: (1)
              earlier local Neolithic populations and (2) populations related
              to the Chalcolithic Zagros or the Bronze Age Caucasus. The
              non-local contribution increased over time, as evinced by three
              outliers who can be modeled as descendants of recent migrants. We
              show evidence that different ``Canaanite'' groups genetically
              resemble each other more than other populations. We find that
              Levant-related modern populations typically have substantial
              ancestry coming from populations related to the Chalcolithic
              Zagros and the Bronze Age Southern Levant. These groups also
              harbor ancestry from sources we cannot fully model with the
              available data, highlighting the critical role of post-Bronze-Age
              migrations into the region over the past 3,000 years.",
