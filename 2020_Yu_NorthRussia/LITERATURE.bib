  abstract = "Modern humans have inhabited the Lake Baikal region since the
              Upper Paleolithic, though the precise history of its peoples over
              this long time span is still largely unknown. Here, we report
              genome-wide data from 19 Upper Paleolithic to Early Bronze Age
              individuals from this Siberian region. An Upper Paleolithic
              genome shows a direct link with the First Americans by sharing
              the admixed ancestry that gave rise to all non-Arctic Native
              Americans. We also demonstrate the formation of Early Neolithic
              and Bronze Age Baikal populations as the result of prolonged
              admixture throughout the eighth to sixth millennium BP. Moreover,
              we detect genetic interactions with western Eurasian steppe
              populations and reconstruct Yersinia pestis genomes from two
              Early Bronze Age individuals without western Eurasian ancestry.
              Overall, our study demonstrates the most deeply divergent
              connection between Upper Paleolithic Siberians and the First
              Americans and reveals human and pathogen mobility across Eurasia
              during the Bronze Age.",
