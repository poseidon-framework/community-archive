The dataset of new individuals and new data on previously published individuals is discussed in reference (2). Annotation is provided in the supplementary data of (2):

  Data S1: Individuals with newly reported data
  Data S2: Libraries from individuals with newly reported data
  Data S3: Newly reported C14 dates
  Data S4: Full list of analyzed individuals (this includes literature data co-analyzed with the newly reported data)
  Data S5: Ancestry and Phenotype information for individuals

The data release contains three files in packedancestrymap format that can be processed using EIGENSOFT (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/software/) and ADMIXTOOLS (https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools)

54 present-day individuals (listed in NonPublic.txt) from the literature do not have permissions consistent with fully public release; please consult the original publications.

BAM files with sequencing reads for the newly reported data can be accessed from the European Nucleotide Archive using accession number: PRJEB54831
