  abstract = "Genomic studies conducted on ancient individuals across Europe
              have revealed how migrations have contributed to its present
              genetic landscape, but the territory of present-day France has
              yet to be connected to the broader European picture. We generated
              a large dataset comprising the complete mitochondrial genomes,
              Y-chromosome markers, and genotypes of a number of nuclear loci
              of interest of 243 individuals sampled across present-day France
              over a period spanning 7,000 y, complemented with a partially
              overlapping dataset of 58 low-coverage genomes. This panel
              provides a high-resolution transect of the dynamics of maternal
              and paternal lineages in France as well as of autosomal
              genotypes. Parental lineages and genomic data both revealed
              demographic patterns in France for the Neolithic and Bronze Age
              transitions consistent with neighboring regions, first with a
              migration wave of Anatolian farmers followed by varying degrees
              of admixture with autochthonous hunter-gatherers, and then
              substantial gene flow from individuals deriving part of their
              ancestry from the Pontic steppe at the onset of the Bronze Age.
              Our data have also highlighted the persistence of
              Magdalenian-associated ancestry in hunter-gatherer populations
              outside of Spain and thus provide arguments for an expansion of
              these populations at the end of the Paleolithic Period more
              northerly than what has been described so far. Finally, no major
              demographic changes were detected during the transition between
              the Bronze and Iron Ages.",
