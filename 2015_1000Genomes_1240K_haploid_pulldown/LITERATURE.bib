  abstract = "The 1000 Genomes Project set out to provide a comprehensive
              description of common human genetic variation by applying
              whole-genome sequencing to a diverse set of individuals from
              multiple populations. Here we report completion of the project,
              having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26
              populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome
              sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray
              genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic
              variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single
              nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short
              insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants),
              all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes
              >99\% of SNP variants with a frequency of >1\% for a variety of
              ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation
              across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common
              disease studies.",
