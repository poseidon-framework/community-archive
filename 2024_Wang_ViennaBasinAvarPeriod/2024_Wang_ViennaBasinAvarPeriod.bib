  abstract  = "After a long-distance migration, Avars with Eastern Asian
               ancestry arrived in Eastern Central Europe in 567 to 568 CE and
               encountered groups with very different European ancestry1,2. We
               used ancient genome-wide data of 722 individuals and fine-grained
               interdisciplinary analysis of large seventh- to eighth-century CE
               neighbouring cemeteries south of Vienna (Austria) to address the
               centuries-long impact of this encounter1,2. We found that even
               200 years after immigration, the ancestry at one site
               (Leobersdorf) remained dominantly East Asian-like, whereas the
               other site (M{\"{o}}dling) shows local, European-like ancestry.
               These two nearby sites show little biological relatedness,
               despite sharing a distinctive late-Avar culture3,4. We
               reconstructed six-generation pedigrees at both sites including up
               to 450 closely related individuals, allowing per-generation
               demographic profiling of the communities. Despite different
               ancestry, these pedigrees together with large networks of distant
               relatedness show absence of consanguinity, patrilineal pattern
               with female exogamy, multiple reproductive partnerships (for
               example, levirate) and direct correlation of biological
               connectivity with archaeological markers of social status. The
               generation-long genetic barrier was maintained by systematically
               choosing partners with similar ancestry from other sites in the
               Avar realm. Leobersdorf had more biological connections with the
               Avar heartlands than with M{\"{o}}dling, which is instead linked
               to another site from the Vienna Basin with European-like
               ancestry. Mobility between sites was mostly due to female exogamy
               pointing to different marriage networks as the main driver of the
               maintenance of the genetic barrier.",
