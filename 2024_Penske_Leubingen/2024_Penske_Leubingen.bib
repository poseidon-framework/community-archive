  abstract  = "With the beginning of the Early Bronze Age in Central Europe ~
               2200 BC, a regional and supra-regional hierarchical social
               organization emerged with few individuals in positions of power
               (chiefs), set apart by rich graves with extensive burial
               constructions. However, the social organization and
               stratification within the majority of people, who represent the
               non-elite, remain unclear. Here, we present genome-wide data of
               46 individuals from the Early Bronze Age burial ground of
               Leubingen in today's Germany, integrating archaeological, genetic
               and strontium isotope data to gain new insights into Early Bronze
               Age societies. We were able to reconstruct five pedigrees which
               constitute the members of close biological kinship groups
               (parents and their offspring), and also identify individuals who
               are not related to individuals buried at the site. Based on
               combined lines of evidence, we observe that the kinship structure
               of the burial community was predominantly patrilineal/virilocal
               involving female exogamy. Further, we detect a difference in the
               amount of grave goods among the individuals buried at Leubingen
               based on genetic sex, age at death and locality but see no
               difference in the types of grave goods.",
